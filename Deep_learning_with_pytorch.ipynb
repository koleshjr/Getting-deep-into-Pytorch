        "* If you can build a simple rule based system that satisfies your need don't use machine learning\n",
        "\n",
        "### When is ML suitable?\n",
        "* Problems with long list of rules\n",
        "* Problems with continously changing environment\n",
        "* Problems with huge amounts of data available\n",
        "\n",
        "### When is Ml not suitable\n",
        "* Explaining patterns - lot's of numbers that define patterns and that are not interpretable by humans\n",
        "* When the traditional approach is more suitable \n",
        "* When errors are unacceptable - makes prediction based on probability so not 100% correct\n",
        "* When you don't have much data\n",

        "### ML VS DL\n",

        "* inputs -> numerical encoding -> learn representations(patterns) -> outputs -> find a way to reduce the error margin -> convert into human understandable outputs\n",

        "### Types of Learning\n",
        "* Supervised Learning - uses known set of labels\n",
        "* Unsupervised learning - does not use a set of known labels e.g clustering\n",
        "* Semi - supervised learning - uses both known labels and unknown to make predictions. Used when there is insufficient data e.g self training\n",
        "* Transfer learning - a model trained on a first task is reused as a starting point of a second task. You finetune it for the next task, useful to create better models from minimal data \n",
        "*Reinforcement learning - allows agents to learn from the environment by taking action and receiving rewards for the actions they have taken. Goal is to maximize the rewards achieving optimization\n",
        "\n",
        "### What is deep learning currently used for \n",
        "* You can use ML for practically anything as long as you can convert the problem into numbers and program it to find patterns\n",

        "* Natural Language Processing\n",
        "* Voice recognition\n",
        "* Object detection e.t.c\n",
        "* Can be generalised into classifications and regression problems\n",

        "* Provides a rich ecosystem of tools and libraries to easily develop deep neural networks\n",
